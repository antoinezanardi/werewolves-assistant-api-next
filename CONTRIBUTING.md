# üåü Contributing

You want to contribute to this project, and we're thankful for that ‚ù§. But first, please be sure to read the contribution guidelines before making or requesting a change.

## ü§ù How To Contribute

1. [**Fork**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the project.
2. Create a new topic branch on your local forked copy. Its name must respect the git flow branch naming convention. You can name it `feat/[NAME_OF_YOUR_FEATURE]` or `fix/[NAME_OF_YOUR_FIX]`. To create a new branch for your feature or your fix, please run `npm run script:create-branch` and follow the steps.
3. Before committing any change, install *Husky hooks* with `npm i`. Hooks will ensure that your branch name, commit, code quality and tests respect the project conventions and rules.
4. Push your topic branch up to your fork. Don't forget to add [**tests**](https://github.com/antoinezanardi/werewolves-assistant-api-next/tree/main/tests). Please read the ESLint rules and the commit messages format in the dedicated sections below.
5. [**Open a Pull Request**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with a clear title and description against the `develop` branch. You can use the `npm run script:create-pull-request` command to automatically create a PR against the `develop` branch from the current branch.

## ‚úÖ ESLint rules for TypeScript files

In order to keep the code clean, consistent and free of bad JS/TS practises, **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** is installed with more than **300 rules activated** !

Complete list of all enabled rules is available in the **[.eslintrc.js file](https://github.com/antoinezanardi/werewolves-assistant-api-next/blob/main/.eslintrc.js)**.

All pull requests containing code which doesn't respect those rules won't be accepted by the CI, and thus, won't be merged.

## üÜï Commit Messages

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory, and the **scope** of the header is optional as of **body** and **footer**.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters ! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

#### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.
In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

#### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature.
* **fix**: A bug fix.
* **docs**: Documentation only changes.
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
* **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.

#### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `test`, `ci`, `algorithm`, `python`, etc...

You can use `*` when the change affects more than a single scope.

#### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

#### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

#### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
[reference GitHub issues that this commit closes][closing-issues].

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.
The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

A detailed explanation can be found in this [document][commit-message-format].
